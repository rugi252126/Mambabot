# Mambabot

## 1. Introduction
Mambabot is an autonomous driving car. The named "Mambabot" is derived from the nickname of the late basketball super star Kobe Bryant.

The project is in state of "proof of concept". For now, I will mainly use the prototype for my personal study and research.

My study and research will mainly focus on the four pillars of self-driving cars.
- Perception
- Localization
- Planning
- Control
